# Coffee Machine

This Python program simulates a coffee machine. It allows users to choose from different coffee options, checks for available resources, processes payments, and makes coffee accordingly.

## Features

- Choose from different coffee options: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Check available resources such as water, milk, and coffee beans.
- Process payment using coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).
- Dispense coffee if the payment is sufficient and resources are available.
- Print a report of available resources and money received.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script to start the coffee machine program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a coffee type, insert coins, and receive your coffee.
3. Use the "report" command to print a report of available resources and money received.
4. Use the "off" command to turn off the coffee machine.

## Dependencies

- This program uses the `art` library to display ASCII art (the coffee machine logo).

```bash
python main.py
